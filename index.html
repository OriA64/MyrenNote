                I am so sorry that I didnt get you a real physical card. But I love you so much I dont think you understand.
                I dont want to like "scare" you with gifts or wtv but its like how I show people that I care abt them. And I really care about you Myren. Ever single time I see you
                I genuinely feel so happy. Seeing you smile when I open the door, and being able to hold you is all I can ask for.
